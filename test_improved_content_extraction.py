    Meeting started at 10:00 AM
    
    Bruce: Good morning everyone. Today we're going to discuss the new fabrication workflow process.
    
    Sarah: Yes, we need to make sure all fabricators understand the new procedures.
    
    Bruce: Exactly. The new workflow starts with material receiving and inspection. Each piece needs to be checked for quality before it goes to the staging area.
    
    Sarah: Right, and then the material moves through the fabrication stations in sequence. Station 1 handles cutting, Station 2 does assembly, and Station 3 is finishing.
    
    Bruce: Important safety note - all fabricators must wear proper PPE at each station. Hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots are mandatory.
    
    Sarah: And we need to document everything. Each step in the process requires proper documentation and quality checkpoints.
    
    Bruce: Yes, quality control is critical. We have checkpoints at each station to ensure the work meets our standards.
    
    Sarah: What about the handoff procedures between stations?
    
    Bruce: Good question. Each station must complete a handoff checklist before the work moves to the next station. This includes quality verification and safety checks.
    
    Sarah: And we need to report any issues immediately. If there's a problem with materials or equipment, stop work and notify the supervisor.
    
    Bruce: Exactly. Safety first, always. Now let's talk about the finishing process...
    
    Sarah: The finishing station handles final quality inspection, packaging, and preparation for shipment.
    
    Bruce: Right. Each completed item gets a final inspection before it's packaged and labeled for shipping.
    
    Sarah: And we need to maintain accurate records of everything that goes through the process.
    
    Bruce: Absolutely. Documentation is key for quality control and compliance.
    
    Sarah: Any questions about the new workflow?
    
    Bruce: If anyone has questions, please ask your supervisor or come to me directly.
